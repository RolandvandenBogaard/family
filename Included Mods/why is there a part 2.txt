Details of how mods load and merge are complex and dumb.
Basically, some parts of my mod need to load AFTER the base
game, and some need to load before.

Load order:
    1. EspEcon (and vanilla files not in EspEcon)
    [if you want to run other mods, put them here]
    2. EspEcon part 2

When this loads, this will happen:

EspEcon
  Vanilla files that EspEcon does not alter get loaded.
  EspEcon gets loaded.

EspEcon part 2
  More EspEcon files load; these needed to load after the
    vanilla stuff.
  The "Vanilla Gnomoria Files" folder (inside part 2)
    Vanilla files that EspEcon has already altered get loaded.
      (The Vanilla objects that already exist in EspEcon will
      be ignored.)
