  <!-- Adds the new Salt items. Why the two-step process to make Salt?
       I wanted the mineable salt "ore" to be mostly-ignorable if someone
       doesn't want it. This allows me to make the salt "ore" clusters
       small, but still make enough salt for someone who does want it.
       
       An upcoming mod I am working on, EspFood will use Salt for cooking.-->
