    Good bones and calcium will come to you, but only if you butcher a

===== VERSION 0.1.3 "Two Minor Fixes" =====
Fixed a rare game crash when generating Agricultural merchants with 36
or higher population.

I moved "Vanilla Gnomoria Files" inside "EspEcon part 2".
Now making a multi-mod is less confusing.

If you attempt to use multiple mods, I recommend making EspEcon the base
mod, and letting it include in this order:
    1. [other mods go here]
    2. EspEcon part 2

Good luck.





===== VERSION 0.1.2 "Multi-Mod and Gnomoria Updates Support" =====
I greatly trimmed down every file in EspEcon. They're now much smaller,
much less redundant, and much less likely to conflict with other mods.

If you attempt to use multiple mods, I recommend making EspEcon the base
mod, and letting it include in this order:
    1. [other mods go here]
    2. EspEcon part 2
    3. Vanilla Gnomoria Files

Good luck.





===== VERSION 0.1.1 "It turns out MaterialID is (NOT optional)" =====
faction.xml states that MaterialID is (optional) in the documentation.
This is false.

This patch fixes a crash bug related to not using MaterialID.

faction.xml:
    ALL vendor items now specify a material; this fixed a crash bug.





===== VERSION 0.1 "Work in Progress" =====
Ok, so for now they're not "patch notes" so much as "what does this mode even do?"

EspEcon - Espoire's Gnomoria Economy Mod

EspEcon makes the traders that visit your kingdom more interesting.
They'll offer different items each visit. Also, hopefully different
